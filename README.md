### Comprehensive Jira Dashboard Plan for Monitoring Multiple Projects (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3)

#### **Dashboard Objectives**

To address the challenges of inconsistent status definitions, outdated backlog items, and scattered sprint focus, this dashboard will:
- Consolidate and visualize work across sprints into a unified executive view.
- Enable monitoring of blockers, sprint progress, quarterly updates, backlog health, workload distribution, and responsiveness.
- Leverage advanced JQL queries for targeted insights.
- Implement automation rules to streamline workflows and highlight critical issues.

---

### **Dashboard Gadgets and JQL Queries**

- **Purpose:** Highlight critical blockers by type, assignee, and project.
- **JQL Query:**  
  `project in (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3) AND status = "Blocked" AND priority in (High, Critical)`
- **Metrics Displayed:** 
  - Total blockers per project
  - Breakdown by assignee
  - Categorization by blocker type

---

#### **2. Sprint Progress**
- **Purpose:** Provide a centralized view of sprint metrics for all projects.
- **JQL Query:**  
  `project in (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3) AND sprint in openSprints()`
- **Metrics Displayed:** 
  - Issues completed
  - In-progress issues
  - Remaining issues

---

#### **3. Quarterly Work**
- **Purpose:** Monitor work updated or created within the current quarter.
- **JQL Query:**  
  `project in (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3) AND updated >= startOfMonth("-3")`
- **Metrics Displayed:** 
  - Total work created
  - Work updated
  - Progress trends by month

---

#### **4. Backlog Health**
- **Purpose:** Identify unresolved backlog items untouched for 90+ days.
- **JQL Query:**  
  `project in (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3) AND status = "To Do" AND updated <= -90d`
- **Metrics Displayed:** 
  - Aging backlog items
  - Assignee for inactive tasks
  - Suggested cleanup actions

---

#### **5. Average Resolution Time per Assignee**
- **Purpose:** Assess efficiency in resolving issues.
- **Implementation:**

  `project in (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3) AND assignee is not EMPTY`
- **Metrics Displayed:** 
  - Story points or issue count per assignee
  - Utilization percentage

---

#### **7. Time to First Response**
- **Purpose:** Measure responsiveness to new issues.
- **Implementation:** 
  - Use SLA fields or custom queries based on timestamps.
- **Metrics Displayed:** 
  - Time from creation to first update/comment
  - Outliers requiring attention

---

#### **8. Aging Work in Progress**
- **Purpose:** Highlight issues stuck in progress for extended periods.

  - **By Reporter:** `project in (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3) AND reporter is not EMPTY`
  - **By Status:** `project in (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3)`
- **Metrics Displayed:** 
  - Proportions by status, assignee, and reporter

---

### **Automation Rules**

#### **1. Flagging Outdated Backlog Items**
- **Purpose:** Identify and label items untouched for 90 days.
- **Rule:**  
  WHEN `issue updated < -90d AND status = "To Do"` THEN `add label "stale"`

---

#### **2. Escalating Blockers**
- **Purpose:** Notify project leads about unresolved blockers.
- **Rule:**  
  WHEN `status = "Blocked" AND updated < -7d` THEN `send email to project lead`

---

#### **3. Automating Status Transitions**
- **Purpose:** Streamline workflows for issues without updates.
- **Rule:**  
  WHEN `status = "In Progress" AND updated < -14d` THEN `transition to "In Review"`

---

### **Industry Best Practices**

#### **1. Backlog Cleanup**
- Conduct monthly or quarterly backlog grooming sessions.
- Use filters to identify and resolve outdated issues:
  - `project in (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3) AND status = "To Do" AND updated <= -90d`
- Resolve or merge redundant tickets.

---

#### **2. Workload Balancing**
- Monitor capacity utilization to prevent overload.
- Balance work using story points or issue counts.

---

#### **3. Standard Workflow Template**
- Adopt a consistent workflow: **To Do → In Progress → In Review → Done**.
- Minimize custom statuses unless justified by unique needs.

---

#### **4. Clear Ticket Creation Criteria**
- Define strict criteria for ticket creation.
- Avoid creating tickets for routine or automated tasks.

---

This dashboard setup will provide a structured and actionable view of team performance, sprint progress, and project health. Let me know if further adjustments are needed.



To create a consistent and clear naming convention for your filters, ensure the names are concise, descriptive, and standardized. Including your organization name, project identifiers, and filter purpose helps ensure clarity and ease of use.

### **Naming Convention Structure**
Use the following structure for naming your filters:
`[OrgName]_[Project/Group]_[Filter Purpose]`

- **[OrgName]**: Include your organization name or abbreviation (e.g., "ABC") for consistent branding.
- **[Project/Group]**: Specify the relevant project(s) or group (e.g., "PRJ1," "PRJ2," "AllProjects").
- **[Filter Purpose]**: Clearly describe the filter's objective (e.g., "Blockers," "SprintProgress").

---

### **Examples of Filter Names**

#### **Blocker Filters**
- `ABC_PRJ1_Blockers`
- `ABC_PRJ2_Blockers`
- `ABC_AllProjects_Blockers`

#### **Sprint Progress Filters**
- `ABC_PRJ1_SprintProgress`
- `ABC_AllProjects_SprintProgress`

#### **Quarterly Work Filters**
- `ABC_PRJ1_QuarterlyWork`
- `ABC_AllProjects_QuarterlyWork`

#### **Backlog Health Filters**
- `ABC_PRJ1_BacklogHealth`
- `ABC_AllProjects_BacklogHealth`

#### **Average Resolution Time Filters**
- `ABC_PRJ1_ResolutionTime`
- `ABC_AllProjects_ResolutionTime`

#### **Team Capacity Filters**
- `ABC_PRJ1_CapacityUtilization`
- `ABC_AllProjects_CapacityUtilization`

#### **Time to First Response Filters**
- `ABC_PRJ1_FirstResponse`
- `ABC_AllProjects_FirstResponse`

#### **Aging Work Filters**
- `ABC_PRJ1_AgingInProgress`
- `ABC_AllProjects_AgingInProgress`

#### **Reopened Issues Filters**
- `ABC_PRJ1_ReopenedIssues`
- `ABC_AllProjects_ReopenedIssues`

#### **Pie Chart Filters**
- `ABC_AllProjects_StatusDistribution`
- `ABC_AllProjects_AssigneeDistribution`
- `ABC_AllProjects_ReporterDistribution`

---

### **Best Practices for Filter Naming**
1. **Be Consistent**: Stick to a uniform naming pattern across all filters.
2. **Use Abbreviations Judiciously**: Only abbreviate if the meaning is universally clear (e.g., "Blockers" or "Capacity").
3. **Avoid Redundancy**: Do not include unnecessary details in filter names. For example, avoid "Filter" at the end of every name (e.g., use `ABC_PRJ1_Blockers` instead of `ABC_PRJ1_Blockers_Filter`).
4. **Include Shared Scope**: For filters spanning multiple projects, use "AllProjects" or "MultiProjects" as the project name.
5. **Order Filters Logically**: Use alphabetical sorting or categorization by scope (e.g., by project or purpose).

---

### **Benefits of this Approach**
- **Ease of Identification**: Filter names immediately indicate their purpose and scope.
- **Scalability**: New filters can be added seamlessly without disrupting the naming logic.
- **Searchable in Jira**: Filters are easily searchable by project, purpose, or keyword (e.g., "ABC" or "Blockers").
- **Professional Appearance**: Standardized names reflect well-organized workflows, especially for executive visibility. 

Let me know if you would like tailored naming for specific filters or further assistance!





To modify your JQL for identifying work **specific to this quarter**, you can use Jira's advanced date functions like `startOfQuarter()` and `endOfQuarter()`. This ensures that the results dynamically adjust based on the current quarter.

### **Updated JQL for "This Quarter"**

#### **Work Updated or Created in the Current Quarter**
- **JQL Query:**
  ```sql
  project in (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3) AND 
  (created >= startOfQuarter() OR updated >= startOfQuarter())
  ```
- **Explanation:**
  - `project in (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3)`: Filters issues from the specified projects.
  - `(created >= startOfQuarter() OR updated >= startOfQuarter())`: Captures issues either created or updated since the start of the current quarter.

---

#### **Work Resolved in the Current Quarter**
- **JQL Query:**
  ```sql
  project in (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3) AND 
  resolved >= startOfQuarter()
  ```
- **Explanation:**
  - `resolved >= startOfQuarter()`: Finds issues resolved since the beginning of the quarter.
  - Helps measure closure rate or team efficiency for this quarter.

---

#### **Open Issues as of This Quarter**
- **JQL Query:**
  ```sql
  project in (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3) AND 
  created < startOfQuarter() AND 
  (status != "Done" AND status != "Closed")
  ```
- **Explanation:**
  - `created < startOfQuarter()`: Identifies issues created before this quarter.
  - `(status != "Done" AND status != "Closed")`: Excludes completed or closed issues, focusing on unfinished work carried into the quarter.

---

#### **Backlog Items Unresolved for This Quarter**
- **JQL Query:**
  ```sql
  project in (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3) AND 
  status = "To Do" AND 
  updated < startOfQuarter()
  ```
- **Explanation:**
  - Targets unresolved backlog items untouched since the current quarter began.

---

### **Optimized Queries for Specific Metrics**

#### **Blockers Created This Quarter**
- **JQL Query:**
  ```sql
  project in (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3) AND 
  status = "Blocked" AND 
  created >= startOfQuarter()
  ```

#### **Team Performance for the Quarter**
- To track metrics like average resolution time or reopened issues:
  - **Resolution Time**: Use `resolved >= startOfQuarter()`.
  - **Reopened Issues**: Use `status = "Reopened" AND updated >= startOfQuarter()`.

---

### **Advanced Filters for Dashboards**
Update the filter names accordingly for clarity. Here’s a table with examples:

| **Filter Name**                    | **Updated JQL Query**                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ABC_AllProjects_QuarterlyUpdates` | `project in (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3) AND updated >= startOfQuarter()`                      |
| `ABC_AllProjects_CreatedThisQuarter` | `project in (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3) AND created >= startOfQuarter()`                      |
| `ABC_AllProjects_QuarterlyBlockers` | `project in (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3) AND status = "Blocked" AND created >= startOfQuarter()` |
| `ABC_AllProjects_UnresolvedBacklogThisQuarter` | `project in (PRJ1, PRJ2, PRJ3) AND status = "To Do" AND updated < startOfQuarter()` |

These queries will dynamically adjust every quarter without requiring manual updates, aligning with your organization’s need for automated and accurate data insights. Let me know if you need further refinements or new additions!




Creating Rules in Jira

Jira uses Automation Rules to streamline workflows, reduce manual effort, and ensure consistency. Automation rules can be created within Jira’s built-in automation feature (available in Jira Cloud or as an add-on for Jira Data Center/Server).
Steps to Create Automation Rules

    Navigate to Automation Settings
        Go to the Jira Administration section.
        Select System Settings > Automation Rules.

    Create a New Rule
        Click Create Rule.
        Choose a Trigger: The event that starts the automation, such as issue creation, transition, or a scheduled time.
            Example: "Issue Created" or "Scheduled Trigger."
        Add Conditions: Narrow down the scope of the trigger (e.g., specific projects, statuses, or labels).
            Example: Condition: status = "Blocked".

    Define the Action
        Specify what the rule should do when the trigger conditions are met.
            Examples:
                Transition an issue to a new status.
                Add a comment or label to an issue.
                Notify assignees or project leads via email or Slack.

    Test the Rule
        Use the Audit Log to test how the rule runs and ensure it behaves as expected.

    Enable and Monitor
        Turn the rule on and monitor its execution via the Audit Log.
